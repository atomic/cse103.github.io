is a system for doing homework online. It's major advantage is
that the student gets immediate feedback on their answers.

Assignments are weekly. They open and close on Thursday at 5PM. After the
assignment is closed you can log in to find the correct answers.

If you have troubles logging in with your account, please contact TA Zhen Zhai (zzhai@eng.ucsd.edu).
