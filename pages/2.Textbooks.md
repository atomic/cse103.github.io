All of the textbooks are hosted on [Nota-Bene](nb.mit.edu). Nota bene
is an innovative new tool for collaboratively reading a text. If at
any point, while you are reading the text, you have a question or a
comment, you simply drag your mouse over the region of interest and
type in your question. Other students, as well as the instructors, can
see your questions and respond to them. To use nota-bene you need to
be registered to the site. You can register yourself by following

* The main reading material for the course are the
[lecture notes](http://nb.mit.edu/f/16559) written by Sanjoy Dasgupta
and Yoav Freund. Each week you will be assigned material to read from
these lecture notes. 

*  [Introduction to probability](http://nb.mit.edu/f/16681) by Grinsted and Snell.
  This book is a thorough introduction to probability. It covers much
  more than we cover in CSE103. Go to this book when you feel that the
  class notes are not sufficient.
  
*  [Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers](http://nb.mit.edu/f/16682)
  by Allen Downey. This book makes extensive use of code example in
  python to explain statistical concepts in a way that makes sense to programmers.
