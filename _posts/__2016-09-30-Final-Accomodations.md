### Planning for the final
Now that the registration list has been settled, it is time to plan
for the final.

The final time is set (see class calendar). If you have another final
**with overlapping time** or if you have a personal reason, you will
be able to take the example at a different time. If this applies to
you, please send email describing the situation to Zhen Zhai at
*zzhai@eng.ucsd.edu* and title it **Final Conflict**.

Similarly, if you have a letter from the office of students with
disabilities (OSD) that entitles you to extra time during the final,
please send an email to Zhen Zhai at *zzhai@eng.ucsd.edu* and title it
**Final Time Extension**.
