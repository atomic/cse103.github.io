title: Week 2

This week, we talk about combinatorics in more detail. In lecture 4, we focus on combinatorics for uniform outcome distributions. We learn about the so-called Pidgeon hole principle and its applications.
In lecture 5, we continue with combinatorics with some more examples, including hands in a poker game. We will also start an introduction to combinatorics for non-uniform outcome distributions.

Please read chapter 4 & 5 on [Nota-Bene](http://nb.mit.edu/) and finish the second homework on [webwork](http://webwork.cse.ucsd.edu/webwork2/CSE103_Fall2015/) by Thursday 10/8/15 5:00PM.
