## Syllabus ##
1. *Introduction:* Why is prob. and stat. important? The difference between probability and statistics. Examples of problems we will learn how to solve in this course.
2. *Uniform discrete probability:* Set notation, set sizes, sample spaces. Factorial, Permutation and Combination. Computing the probabilities of poker hands.
4. *General Probability spaces:* non-uniform discrete spaces, Kolmogorov's axioms of probability. Uncountably infinite spaces, density distributions.
3. *Probabilistic concepts:* Conditional probability, independence, expectation, variance, covariance.
5.  Generalization of conditional probability, independence, expectation, variance, covariance.
Important density functions: Poisson, Normal, Pareto.
Sums of IID random variables: The binomial distribution, normalized distributions, central limit theorem.
Statistical tests: central limit theorem; hypothesis testing, p-values, Confidence Intervals.
Randomized algorithms: Pseudo-randomness, median finding, minimum cut, hashing, Bloom filters.
